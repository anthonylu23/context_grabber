Build test as you deem necessary.

Update docs as we go (with your best judgement) as necessary. Document both tasks and codebase changes. Document both task status and docs for the codebase (architecture, implementation details, usage, etc.)

Update next steps in docs.

If you are an agent working in parallel with another, be aware of the work the other agents will/are doing

**Feel free to modify AGENTS.md if necessary whenever, use your best judgemenet**. Reread AGENTS.md whenever there are changes made. If there aren't changes to AGENTS.md, no need to read it to avoid context bloat.

Be sensible with typing, file naming, file organization, etc.

When reviewing code, be in depth, detailed, and rigorous with regards to typing, logic, robustness, and running/writing tests. Report back with detailed assessment.

Before making changes, take a look at what changes have been so you have proper context and the tasks.

If new changes shouldn't be pushed to main, let me (the human) know if I should branch, unstage, etc.

Approvals is not needed for **web search**, feel free to use web search when necessary.

**Run tests** following implementation. Ensure types, lint checks, and swift run compiles.

**If deemed necessary suggest refactors, and I will verify whether or not to make the changes.**

When checking for errors, see if its due to a feature not being implemented yet.

### Commiting practices:

When commiting to git, avoid bulk commiting. Commit files together or seperately so commit logs are more detailed.

No need for branching, this is a side project that I'm working on until it gets to a place where I can use it with the features I need for my personal workflow.

Follow stand good git practices
